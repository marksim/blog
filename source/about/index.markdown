## 'Expert' Programmer

I've been programming for nearly 20 years and I've been earning my living at it for most of the last 12.  For the first several years I was a Java programmer, but about 5 years ago I stepped into a job that let me pick technologies.  I was intrested in Rails, so I went with it.  That began a love for Ruby and simplicity that I've tried to nurture ever since.


## A New Adventure

In May 2012 I quit that job to be part of a startup and starting working out of my home.  We (intentionally) have a small home in the suburbs and didn't have an entire room to dedicate to an office, so I am working out of my closet.

This is my basic Cloffice setup.  Standing desk, my laptop (elevated), a keyboard, trackpad and microphone.

Honestly, I've found that I don't need much space.  Standing helps keep me awake and alert.

## Standing Desk

If you're like me, you've probably read many articles about how sitting all day is bad for you.  I had a coworker at my last job use a standing desk and I thought I'd try it.  The first 3 days I was very tired on my feet, but after that I got used to it.

I didn't want to invest something that wasn't going to work out, so I've jerry-rigged this desk by putting it on top of 2 boxes full of all the stuff I've taken to and from every job I've ever had--and rarely used.  I also put a small fan underneath to help keep me cool since the closet has little ventilation.

Yes, that is a Lightning McQueen doormat.  It feels good on my feet.  Shut up.

The best part of the setup is that it's easy to remove the laptop, but it feels like a real workstation.

## What I love

I'll say this, I love developing.  I love finding new ways to look at problems and seeing the look on a users face when they are excited at how cool/easy/awesome something is.  There's a little piece of me that loves the control of it all, but I try to suppress that.  The point is helping people have better lives.
