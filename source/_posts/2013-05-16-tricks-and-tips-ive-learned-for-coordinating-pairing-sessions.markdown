When I heard about the [#pairwithme](http://pairprogramwith.me) idea, I thought it was something I really wanted to do.  I set aside 3 nights a week from 9-10pm and started pinging people on Twitter during that time, asking if they wanted to pair.  I tried for no less than 3 weeks before actually getting a real pairing session going.  I had several cancellations and a bunch of fits and starts trying to figure out how to really communicate with people.  Here's my takeaways from the experience of coordinating sessions remotely.

* Get off of Twitter as quickly as you can.  Go to direct messaging, then get e-mail or some kind of chat to 'formalize' the relationship a bit
* **Use a Calendar and actually send the invite.**  It virtually guarantees that you'll be on their calendar and helps both of you remember.
* Pre-agree on where you'll meet.  Google Plus seems to be the most common, though I've seen some people get into IRC.  Either way, include it in your calendar reminder.
* You need about 1.5 - 2 hours to do a good session.  It takes at least 10 minutes to ramp up and if you're meeting someone for the first time, it can go as long as 30.
* Double book (with people's full knowledge) if you can.  I.e. "If my 8:00pm session cancels, I'll ping you and see if you're available... cool?"

All in all, I've found it difficult to get started, but now I'm booked out for 3 weeks.  We'll see how they go. :)
