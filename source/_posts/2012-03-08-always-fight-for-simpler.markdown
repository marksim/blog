If there is one thing I have said over and over again in one form or another, but never seem to learn completely, it's "Always Fight for Simpler."

Everything could be simpler.  Sure, we think it can't, but it can.  Don't assume you need a feature in an app, a gadget in your life, or a certain amount of money... fight first for simpler.

Ask yourself, for any given situation, what the simplest possible solution to the problem is.  Maybe it's not good enough... but maybe it is.  Fight for the simplest solution and go from there.

Simple doesn't always mean cheap, fast, easy, or perfect.  Simple means it lacks complexity.  Simple means it depends on few other things.  Simple means less instead of more.
