After a few weeks of working on the Ergodox, I've finally found what I believe is an [ideal layout](https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/?referer=MJEC7C&hash=b2450c80be85ac42ae6e8b1641ad4725).

But that's for me.  You'll be different.  You'll think of things differently.  You'll have different needs.  You'll hate where my spacebar is, or my curly braces... and that's exactly what the Ergodox is for.

It's not only ergonomic in the sense that you do not strain your fingers to reach keys around them, but it is also ergonomic in the sense that you can place keys where they make sense.  You could literally come up with your own keyboard format--though I certainly wouldn't suggest it.  

So how do you go about figuring out your best layout?  First, you have to know what keys you use the most and what keys you want access to.
