This last weekend I went to the [Lone Star Ruby Conference 2013](http://www.lonestarruby.org/2013/lsrc).  It was a good conf.  Of course, there were some weak talks and bad wifi issues, but overall, it was the most enjoyable and useful conference I've been to.

## Highlights

* [Sandi Metz](http://twitter.com/sandimetz)'s keynote looking at the history of writing and tech - Always great to hear that you're going to be obselete and thus, you need to remember what your priorities are.
* [Dave Thomas](http://twitter.com/pragdave)'s talk on [Exlir](http://elixir-lang.org) - Showed off the power of the language by live-coding and having a good time doing it.
* [Brandon Hays](http://twitter.com/tehviking)' talk on [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and Rails - perhaps the best beginner talk I've ever seen.  Great combo of funny, interesting, informative and technical enough to be useful.
* [Sarah Mei](http://twitter.com/sarahmei)'s talk on fostering creativity and problem solving - Just a great talk--well delivered and interesting.  Best soft talk of the conf.
* [Nell Shamrell](http://twitter.com/nellshamrell)'s talk on [RegEx](http://rubular.com) - Super informative, well delivered and highly technical without alientating anyone.  200 devs paying attention to every word she's saying about how a RegEx parser works.  That's mad skills.
* [Sam Livingston-Gray](http://twitter.com/geeksam)'s talk on Refactoring - Wonderful talk that dove deep enough to give you an idea of HOW to refactor something.  I always forget that it is one small thing at a time.
* Getting to meet and visit with people I had only known on twitter before like [@_zph](http://twitter.com/_zph) and [@avdi](http://twitter.com/avdi).
* Getting to meet lots of people interesting in [#pairwithme](http://pairprogramwith.me).
* [Bryan Helmkamp](http://twitter.com/brynary): "Your goal is to make refactoring invisible.  It should happen every time you touch the code.  Little improvements here and there."
* Getting to give my [Lightning Talk on #pairwithme](https://speakerdeck.com/marksim/practical-number-pairwithme)

Overall a great conf.  It seemed like the best and most interesting talks weren't focused on Ruby--with the exception of @geeksam's talk on refactoring.  Nearly every talk worth it's salt was either talking about broadening your horizons or improving your code quality.  That's a tall order, and it's a great thing that the Ruby community embraces it.  

There will be no LSRC 2014, but the hope is that there will be one in 2015.  I wonder if the Ruby Community will thrive to a point that makes all these regional conferences possible over the next two years.  Maybe it will and maybe it won't.  We'll see.  Here's to hoping.
