A good software tester…
<ul>
	<li> Constantly asks, “What is the best test I can execute right now”.</li>
	<li> Can log unambiguous bugs with clear repro steps that make the main problem obvious with few words.</li>
	<li>Is not distracted by their understanding of developer decisions. Just because the tester may understand certain technology constraints motivating dev solutions, the tester’s mission is never to defend the AUT see my post, What We Can Learn From Dumb Testers. It is to communicate how the AUT currently works, in areas that matter right now.</li>
</ul>
