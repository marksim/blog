``` json All of JSON by Mike Dewar
{
  "key": "value",
  "boolean": true,
  "list": [
    "element1",
    "element2",
  ],
  "dictionary":{
    "number": 1493,
    "null_value": null,
  }
}
```

From [Mike Dewar's talk on d3.js](http://vimeo.com/35005701)

So nice to see all of a spec so neatly displayed.
