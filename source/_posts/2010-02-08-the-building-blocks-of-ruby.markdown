While the Python version may not be quite as pretty, nothing about them screams “Ruby has much stronger capabilities here”. Instead, by using examples like Sinatra, Rubyists trade in an argument about great semantic power for one about superficial beauty.

Rubyists, Pythonistas and others working on web development share a common language in JavaScript. When describing blocks to “outsiders” who share a common knowledge of JavaScript, we tend to point at JavaScript functions as a close analogue. Unfortunately, this only furthers the confusion.

On the Ruby side, when PHP or Java announces that they’re “adding closures”, many of us don’t stop to ask “what kind of closures?”

Let’s cut to the chase and use a better example of the utility of Ruby blocks.
