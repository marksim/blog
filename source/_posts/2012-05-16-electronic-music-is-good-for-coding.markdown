I've recently been curating a playlist on spotify for [High Energy Electronic Music](http://spoti.fi/IYBsOd) so that I could have something high energy with no lyrics, or at the very least very simple ones that were easy to ignore. The big point was to have something high energy that got me into the coding groove.

I have to say that it's worked.  Having a driving beat and some hard hits has made it really easy to get motivated to code on. Suggestions for similar artists/songs welcome.
