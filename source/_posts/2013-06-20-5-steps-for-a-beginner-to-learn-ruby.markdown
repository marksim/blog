Ruby is not Rails. Learn Ruby first.

* Get [rbenv](rbenv.org) (preferred) or [rvm](http://rvm.io) installed with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.3 and 2.0 
* Write Hello World and run it
``` ruby hello_world.rb
puts "Hello World"
```
* Go through the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) (simplest with 1.8.7)
* Go through some [TDD exercises](/tdd-exercises/)
* Code a simple ruby script that solves a problem you have, like...
    - Add a TODO to a file
    - Print out the date in another time zone
    - Tell you how many days until...
    - Perform some repetative task related to your environment 
    - Display something silly for your kids

Ruby is not Rails. You do not need to learn all the "magic" of Rails to learn the *awesome* of Ruby.  Spend some time and get where you can really drive a script and solve a simple problem.  Doing this will get you far beyond a beginning Rails developer.  You simply have to learn the magic incantations of Rails to be able to develop web apps after that.  And those incantations won't be nearly as scary.
