Shapes in Go aren’t unlike software design patterns. While there is nothing preventing you from placing logic in your views, this shape is recognized to be a weak one. Think of Gang-of-Four design patterns: the MVC, Adapter, and Factory patterns are recognized to be helpful in some circumstances (and not appropriate in others). On a lower level, iteration and recursion have commonly recognized shapes, as do database normalization vs. denormalization. Even if you can’t hold an entire program or algorithm in your head at once, recognizing common shapes helps you to understand what is going on.
