Yesterday, one of my inter-web buddies IM’d me and asked if I had used Typhoeus before. I said yes, so he asked me if it was possible to follow redirects using it. He said he google’d it and nothing turned up.

I sharply responded, “LOOK AT THE CODE!”. We had some banter back and forth and a few minutes later he was automatically following redirects. It seems these days that developers often think if something does not turn up in a google search, it does not exist.
