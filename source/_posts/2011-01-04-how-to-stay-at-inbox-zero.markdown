title: How to Stay At Inbox Zero

I saw a link recently on how to get to the ever elusive "Inbox Zero" and it seemed kinda lame--label everything "oldinbox" and archive everything in Gmail.  Maybe that's the only way to do it when you have 10K+ e-mails in your inbox, but it seems like the best way is to never get there to begin with.

Personally, I haven't had more than 50 e-mail in my inbox at any given time in over 2 years.  I ruthlessly archive and delete items and as soon as I've processed something into an action for "Things" I get it out of my inbox.  For e-mails I just need to look at, reference or respond to, I use the stars feature, but I have only 8 starred items right now.  I think at some point I had nearly 20... that's about the max.

There are 3 very simple things you can do to <em>stay</em> at Inbox Zero:

<ol>
	<li><b>Use "Multiple Inboxes"</b> - to keep things in front of you, use multiple inboxes (it's a Gmail Labs feature) and make your own version of the priority inbox.<a href="/images/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-3.50.12-PM.png"><img src="/images/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-3.50.12-PM.png" alt="" title="Multiple Inboxes Setup" width="715" height="419" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" /></a></li>
	<li><b>Use a catch-all and your own domain</b> - I have a catch-all address getting checked by Gmail.  I give out e-mail addresses to businesses like "amazon@my.domain.com" that way and have all of the mail that comes in on that domain marked with the label "bulk" -- and I have a "bulk" inbox using "Multiple Inboxes"<a href="/images/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-3.42.09-PM.png"><img src="/images/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-3.42.09-PM.png" alt="" title="Multiple Inboxes" width="645" height="696" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96" /></a></li>
	<li><b>Add "Send and Archive" in labs</b> - Now, everytime you respond to somebody, send and archive, don't just send.  You're done.  Never worry about it again.<a href="/images/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-3.51.09-PM.png"><img src="/images/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-3.51.09-PM.png" alt="" title="Send and Archive" width="706" height="223" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-98" /></a></li>
</ol>

Okay, now you know how to keep a simple and clean inbox.  Go forth and do likewise.
