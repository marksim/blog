The other night, I got to pair with [@piisalie](http://twitter.com/piisalie) to
learn some Emacs and work through a little [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

Paul is a relatively new developer, but he's been studying under the tutelage
of [@jeg2](http://twitter.com/jeg2) and getting ramped up very quickly as a
result.  It's neat to see people who are able to absorb so much so quickly.

### Setup

* Google+ Hangouts
* TMUX + Emacs (Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!)

Paul was pretty familiar with Emacs and did a good job showing me around.  We
worked on a small exercise and I tried to do as much of the editing as possible
as he guided me when I said "how do I move up and down again?"


### Takeaways

* Exercism is a great way to think through a bunch of ways to solve a small
  problem
* Emacs is neat in that...
    - it can actually contain a shell within a buffer and that shell is
      *editable*.
    - the mnemonics are easier to remember
    - it's easy to test out config changes in the scratch buffer
    - fuzzy searching is built in
* Emacs is crazy (mostly in comparison to VIM) in that...
    - nearly every command has a prefix (`C-x`, `C-c`), which seems like
      insanity when you compare moving around/highlighting in VIM with `hjkl`.
      It reminds me of TMUX, which is much more tolerable because you're not
      switching panes *multiple times per second*
    - it seems much *larger* than VIM is
    - The default Emacs on my Mac is version 22, Paul had version 24.  VIM is
      at 7.3 on nearly every system I'm using.
    - it is not VIM and my brain explodes.

All in all, a good session.  I'm glad I have a better understanding of Emacs
and that I understand some things that I specifically *like* about VIM and a
couple of things that I like about Emacs.  Looking forward to  pairing with
Paul again where we can actually work on something real.

On to the next pairing session...
