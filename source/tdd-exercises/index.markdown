One of the best ways to pair with someone new is to go through a TDD exercise with them.  Nearly anyone on any level can implement these through TDD with a little effort.

* Implement a TicTacToe Game / AI
* Implement a [Bowling Scoring System](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata)
* Implement [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) - (check out this [epic video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE) to see what it looks like)
* Implement the [String Calculator](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)
