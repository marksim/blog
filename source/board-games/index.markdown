I love playing board games.  One of my favorite things to do is to consider the rules or thinking that must have gone into board games.  I think trying to code a game up is an incredible exercise in breaking down interesting problems that usually don't need frameworks to solve.  It's just you really understanding logic.

Here's a list of board games I like and know fairly well.  If you're interested in pairing on them and trying to figure them out, ping me [on twitter](http://twitter.com/marksim).  Some of these are more interesting to code up and solve the AI for them, some of them are interesting to just encode the rules.
